The simple answer is: everywhere! Thai street food is among the best in the world, and for
around $5 you can eat a filling and delicious meal. Some food stands have little plastic 
seats where you can sit and eat and they cook the same dish over and over, like fried chicken 
on rice or Pad Thai noodles. Head for Chinatown – Yaowarat Street –  and choose whatever looks 
most interesting from the many excellent Chinese and Thai restaurants and food stands.
